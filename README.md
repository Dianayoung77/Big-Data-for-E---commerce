# Big Data for E-commerce

## Big data analysis of e-commerce platforms（电商平台大数据分析）
During the practical training, I carried out the public opinion processing of the telecommunication data. Then, I tried to conduct the big data analysis of the e-commerce data by myself. 
I wrote a JAR package using Java, and then uploaded it to the Hadoop cluster to implement the four parts, namely data production, data collection, consumption and storage, data analysis, and data display.

As China's e-commerce industry booms, traditional platforms struggle with sluggish sales growth and inefficient data processing. With data storage expanding from GB to PB levels, and business and consumer needs evolving, data analysis is now key. However, traditional analytics architectures fall short in handling large-scale, real-time data. Big data frameworks like Hadoop present new opportunities. This system's design and implementation act as an e-commerce platform's big data analysis project.


本项目分为四个部分，分别为数据生产、数据采集/消费/存储、数据分析以及数据展示，以下是具体介绍：
